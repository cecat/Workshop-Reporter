The need for standardized interfaces between agents\n2. Challenges in maintaining state across distributed systems\n3. Security considerations for federated agent networks\n\nThe group agreed that a common protocol for agent communication would accelerate adoption. Action item: Form a working group to draft initial protocol specifications."
